                <p>What does one say to someone after 37 years of no contact (except for the one text message and my annual birthday wish)? I believe the last time I saw you in person was the evening we drove from Toronto out to Oakville to visit Greg and Patti and see their first born daughter Paige.</p>
                
                <p>I have attempted throughout this adventure (book writing process), to protect your right to privacy and where possible, allow you to make your own decision as to the question that would eventually be asked of you, by a very small group of people (10-15) we both know, <span class="quote">"Are you Rebecca 1.0?"</span></p>
                
                <p>That choice is yours and yours alone. I went as far as making my suggestion in the Disclaimer section on the back of the first page.... I hope it elicited a smile. I decided to create this section exclusively for you as an alternate method for you to privately contact me just in case you needed to yell at me or (hopefully) tell me you enjoyed it and had plenty of laughs along the read. You and I would naturally get the most smiles, laughs, maybe the odd watery eyes and definitely a forced revisit with old memories.</p>
                
                <p>Before you go any further, I want to answer this question; <span class="highlight">"Do I still love you?"</span> Some may think yes, especially after writing a 506 page book..... but the truth to that question I will answer this way. <span class="emotional">I still love my 'It-girl', and you are not that girl anymore as I have surely changed over the past 35 years and would not be the boy you once knew (and who eventually figured out), never did truly love.</span> The girl I fell in love with, and still love, existed back around April 14th, 1978, and who I lost for good that infamous day sitting in the Gremlin (Did I mention, I hate Gremlins now :) )!</p>
                
                <p>It certainly begs the question; <span class="quote">"How could you love someone that never did love you?"</span> It took me a long time to figure that out, but I eventually realized that being in "it-love" does not require the person you love, to share those same feelings.... it simply means that it was a one sided love affair that was destined to come to a very painful end for me, and why it was so easy for you to so quickly move on and be oblivious to my ongoing pain after the dumping.....</p>
                
                <p>I hope when you eventually read my book, you will be able to figure out why I decided to write it. I can assure you that reason/purpose is creatively woven into the story, and you will be in the best position to figure it out. I am also prepared for the potential that you have simply purged those needed memories to deduce the reason/purpose. If that is indeed the case, I would strongly suggest you absolutely take my advice as instructed in the Disclaimer.</p>
                
                <p>As far as the cover design goes, I want you to know how difficult it was for me. When I first created the cover, I did not utilize the question mark and chose instead to use a blurring effect. Unfortunately, even using the blur effect would have allowed certain people to possibly identify you. After many restless nights and mental anguish regarding your privacy issue, I decided to incorporate a question mark. My theory was, only people who knew of the picture under the question mark could identify the person. I tested my theory and can report to you, not one person could identify you. <span class="highlight">The best test came when I showed a very close friend whom you decided to go on a date with (and apparently have sex with) shortly after our breakup.</span> Pat took a look at the website and thought the picture was a young boy, representing a young Derek Devon. I figured since he obviously knew you intimately (which was so hurtful to me when I found out about it, and still pisses me off even now :( ), if he was not able to identify you, then no one could.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, just in case you decide to share access with the man in your life, know that I have certainly made the necessary adjustments in what I am prepared to say to you here and what I will reserve only for a face-to-face, which most likely will never happen. You should keep a copy lying around the house as a subtle reminder that if he should ever start to take you for granted, or does not treat you like a 'Queen', <span class="emotional">there is a famous writer out there biding his time waiting for the moment he slips up!</span> My "depends changing" offer is still on the table (:))</p>
                
                <p>As far as my desire to tell you how much you hurt me with your little Pat episode, I have also had to deal with (one of your old flames), "Jeff T's" golf club barroom boasting claims about his early conquests (Linda G from 'Girls Night Out Photo' and Debbie M), along with far too much detail of your 'sex escapades' with him at Western, that pisses me off as well. And to add salt to that wound, I had to hear about it from my best friend's kid brother (Jeff L) who is a member at the Golf Club (along with your nephew Eric). Anyway, that is a possible discussion for the future.....</p>
                
                <p>I have created a message area that you can access through the button below should you ever feel the need to tear a strip off of me, or tell me to F-off and go to hell (which we both know is where I am headed)... or in the highly unlikely alternative, if you ever felt secure enough in your relationship to get permission from your man to meet and tell me face-to-face, I would suggest the neutral ground of the Dundas Valley Trail Centre. That way you can see the changes occurring at your old homestead.</p>
                
                <p>I would have loved to be a fly on the wall when you first discovered the book. For me, it would also be extremely telling, based on when you would disclose the book to your significant other (Before you read it; Or after?). I don't think I have ever laughed so much as I did writing the book. While Derek 2.0 is off-world, in book 3, Rebecca 2.0 takes on a much greater role in the story, which I would have loved to have your input on, but doubt you would get permission to do something like that (you know I am just having some fun poking the bear... we both know you are far too independent to have to ask anyone for permission, and I would not be shocked to discover you were the alpha in that relationship).</p>

                <p> I have no idea when or if you will read this letter but if you're reading it for the first time, I am planning on heading to my 41 foot sailboat "It-Girl" (yes I named it in honour of you) for a three year circumnavigation (around the world in 1,095 days). Who know's, I may fall in love with some other part of the world and never return except to the unfortunate odd funeral. So, if you read this after January 2026, then the Dundas Valley meet and greet won't fit my travel schedule. But rest assured, you will continue to occupy a very large and special place in my heat and my life. The almost three years I got to be "Your Guy" was the best almost three years in my entire life (so far...). And before you say "What a pathetic loser", just remember, this pathetic loser got to be with the hottest, cutest and best girl in High School for almost three years! I know you will be busy spending time with your kids and grandkids (never thought I would ever call you Granny :)), but I hope that every now and then you may stop to think about where I may be in the world at that moment and just maybe make a dimpled smile for me. </p>
                
                <p><span class="highlight">One last request is to please say hello to 'Todd and Brenda' (hehe) for me.</span> I have kept somewhat informed as to 'Cynders' accomplishments, but have no idea what Owen is up to. So, that is it, feel free to go take a strip off me in the message area (Only you and I have access to this area in case you were wondering and I have programmed a little monitoring bot that will notify me when you have entered this area). After all, I am a computer genius (lol).</p>

                <p> And this is the last paragraph I assure you! It turns out I actually love writing. I may not be that good (yet) but practice makes better! I have written a 10 episode streaming series called "Living With The Ghost of Sam" (www.lwtgos.com) which I am currently converting into a mini book series and I just finished a 16 book series called "The Last Axiom" (www.thelastaxiom.com). You probably should read them... hint...hint.. And I hope I did not offend you with the selection of the background image for the <i>"I am the Original"</i> Button. As you know, it has always been my kryptonite! </p>
