                <div class="letter-body">
                    <p>If you're here reading this, then I lost a bet to Greg. I told him I highly doubted you would ever bother to visit the website—even if you found out I wrote a book that contained some stories from the time we had dated. I tried to explain to him that "you were not wired that way" (yes, one of my favorite expressions, if you ever did read any of my writings).</p>
                    <p>When we were a couple, you were always the optimist and forward thinker, while I was Mr. Analysis. I am even worse at that than when you knew me. But just on the off chance I was wrong and you are actually reading this, then I will try to keep it on topic, so to speak.</p>
                    <p>I suspect that you have always either known or suspected—at a few points in your life, mostly a long time ago, or around the time I sent you that text—that I had never gotten over you. If you didn't, well... maybe you should read the book "A Letter Guide For Rebecca," because it would support my position that I have never gotten over you. In fact, it would most likely support a much worse condition than that.</p>
                    <p>You see, that infamous day you drove to my place in the Gremlin and proceeded to tell me you wanted to break up because you wanted to go to University single... Yes, that day... Well, something I would like you to know is it was not just a simple high school girlfriend and boyfriend break-up for me. It was emotionally devastating. What I did not disclose to you when I returned from Miami was that, for me, I had come to the personal and emotional view that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. Yup, I had fallen all the way! Not only was I madly in love with you, I wanted to marry you in the near future. The problem, though—I knew I couldn't tell you then, out of fear it may send you packing (scare you on some level). Truth be told, I know you said before I left for school, "I think I am falling in love with you." I was waiting for a new sign that that was true... Thus my dilemma.</p>
                    <p>Now, before I get any further with this past truth, I want you to know that what I am about to tell you—you did nothing wrong. You were a young woman (girl) who had a high school boyfriend and was trying to figure out what you wanted to do with your life. You never misled me or would want to intentionally hurt me; that, I know in my heart. But as you had come to a different point in your life regarding me, I was all in on you. And that day you broke up with me broke me. I was devastated beyond words. I was also not capable of accepting or dealing with the emotional trauma. That was something I never understood back then. I was a very smart and capable person, and because I lacked the ability to deal with the emotional trauma, my brain kicked in and did what it was good at—it decided to counter the enormous pain I was experiencing. My solution was simply to figure out how to win you back.</p>
                    <p>I know you knew on some level how I felt, even after the break-up. If our trip to London to your new house just before your first year at Western didn't tip you off, there were many other signs. It eventually consumed not only all my mental processing but also all my own personal ambition and desires. Believe me, looking back, I so wished I could have simply licked my emotional wounds and moved on. Maybe I would be married to Maureen Hanmer today (a joke, if you didn't read any of my writings). There were a few other moments involving you that added to my emotional instability over the dumping that I know you have no idea of. The first—and I would say the moment that pushed me over the edge of my own sanity—was running into you and Jeff Teal at your house. Not sure if you even remember that encounter. I had just stopped by to say hello to your folks (still trying to keep one foot in the door...), and as I was leaving, you guys drove into your driveway.</p>
                    <p>Seeing you with him was more than I could take. I learned how to put on a good face, and that time, I think, was worthy of at least an Oscar nod. For the next couple of weeks, I found myself spiraling into the deepest depression I have—and had—ever experienced. I hid it from everyone. Greg was away at school, so I couldn't talk to him. And you would have been the only other person I could have opened up to. At the lowest point, I started planning my own suicide—and you know it was not just going to be a quiet and simple one with me. No... I was going to make it a spectacular offing. I was going to hang myself at the Hermitage, along with a love note that I was hoping would devastate you, hurt you, believing you needed to experience, if only for a moment, what I was experiencing consantly at that time.</p>
                    <p>But what I didn't expect to discover about myself was twofold. First, I was concerned that people may try to call me a coward for taking the easy way out of the pain I was in. And then the other thing that saved me was also going to be somewhat of a curse... I could never hurt you. Especially that way. So, I finally made a decision that I needed to get out of Dodge! I needed to get far away and try to figure it out in a way that didn't include me killing myself. So that became my new plan. Unfortunately for me, I was also broke and didn't have the money to flee to emotional safety. And now we come full circle to my other curse... I was a very smart and capable guy!</p>
                    <p>Okay, maybe not as smart as I thought... And that, my former love of my life (from my perspective), is something I have always wanted to confess to you but never got the opportunity till now. Only two people know about this now—me and you. Greg doesn't even know.</p>
                    <p>After my release and eventual return to Toronto and my job at Matrix Financial, there was one more major event that had a tremendous impact on me. It was the day you called me at my office and tried to pitch me on some new share offering your company was promoting. Yup, I was now simply a stock potential chump customer! I guess you could actually view this as the moment I came to grips that I was not the one. I handled it much better than the other major emotional blow you delivered and ended up spending a lot of time at the gym lifting weights! But even that was not free from an eventual negative side effect. Turns out I compressed my lower spine a lot, and today I enjoy some good old-fashioned arthritis pain...</p>
                    <p>After that call, you would not have noticed (you're not wired that way), but I never did contact you again. For me, I was relegated to trying to find the second-best girl in the world for me... And that, my wonderfully gifted backside, love of my life, is a story that may have to find itself into a future book. Although, a lot of my life is woven into "A Letter Guide For Rebecca." It was my first attempt at writing, and at the time I decided to write the book, it was more about being able to tell (document) my story on some level than trying to be some great writer. That being said, what I did come to realize: I actually enjoyed the writing process a great deal, and I think my writing is constantly improving. I wrote a TV series called "Living With the Ghost of Sam," which I eventually converted into a 10-book novella series. In my latest effort (as of 2025), I wrote a science fiction/love story series called "The Last Axiom." It is a 16-book series.</p>
                    <p>Who knew I was so creatively inclined? I also expressed my old musical desires and wrote a song for Michael Smerconish's POTUS Radio show called "The Mingle Effect." They use it on the show when he talks about his "Mingle Project" crusade. And there was no way I would write a book called "A Letter Guide For Nancy" without writing the future theme song for the eventual movie they will make (you better be smiling at this). The original version was called "Nancy's Song," but I changed it when I decided to protect your privacy and changed it to "Rebecca's Song" (aka Nancy's Song). Both songs are on the respective websites of the same name and available on Spotify or YouTube. So, if you ever decide to claim the title as being Rebecca 1.0, you can tell your kids that someone wrote a song about you! That Aka Nancy is actually you.</p>
                    <p>That's it, Nancy. I know you reached your limit, and I will once again prognosticate that you will quickly digest this and move on with your life! However, also being a computer genius, I did leave you a private message system should you ever need to yell at me or want to tell me to leave you alone! You already know that is not happening. But I would encourage you to go to the message system (link below) and take a look at a special photo album I put together. It's been 37 years since we last saw each other, so I think you can handle a short trip down memory lane along with a couple of funny pics. I leave for my 3-year circumnavigation on my boat "It-Girl" (yes, named after you) starting January 2026. I highly doubt we will ever see each other before my death (hopefully not too soon), and I was able to confirm through Greg and Jeff's recent birthday wish that your cell phone number is still active (I would bet you figured out I was behind that). I stopped sending you your annual birthday wish, figuring it was now your turn to send one to me. I think we both know you're not wired that way (now you better be laughing), but I was worried you had me on call blocking and didn't get my annual birthday wish...</p>
                    <p>So, I will end this here by simply telling you that I think about you almost every day. You were the one for me, the absolute love of my life, and the almost three years we were together are, by far, the greatest three years of my life—and that will never change. I am sure you will, in some form or another, continue to be a part of my writings should I continue to write, and I sincerely wish you a happy, healthy, and wonderful life. I just won't call you Granny!</p>
